*Welcome to the Spring 2026 offering of CX 4240!*

This course introduces fundamental techniques for computational data analysis, with an emphasis on machine learning algorithms and their applications to real-world data.

On the technique side, the course covers key machine learning methods, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, tree-based models, and self-supervised learning for foundation models.

On the application side, the course explores a variety of real-world applications of these techniques. Students will learn how to formulate real-world tasks as data analysis problems, understand the core methods for solving them, and analyze their strengths and limitations.

The learning objective is that by the end of this course, students will be able to formulate data analysis problems, select appropriate computational models to extract insights from data automatically, and develop innovative solutions to open problems in applied data science and machine learning.

**Target Audience:**
- **Practitioners:** This course is ideal for students who wish to solve practical problems using machine learning and data science techniques in real-world settings.
- **Researchers:** The course provides essential foundations and advanced tools for students interested in conducting cutting-edge research in data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, and related areas.

**Prerequisites:**
- Solid knowledge of probability, statistics, calculus, and linear algebra; 
- Basic knowledge of machine learning; 
- Solid programming skills, preferably in Python.
