#### Deep generative models for disentangled representation learning
**Contact person:** [Paul Liang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pliang/){:target="\_blank"}

Disentangled representation learning involves learning a set of latent variables that each capture individual factors of variation in the data.
For example, when we learn a generative model for shapes, it would be ideal if each latent variables would correspond to the shapes pose, shadow, rotations, lighting etc.
This improves interpretability of our learned representations and allows flexible generation from latent variables.
You can explore new methods of learning disentangled representations in both supervised and unsupervised settings (i.e. whether information about pose, shadow, rotations are given or not), design metrics for improved evaluation of disentanglement in models, as well as new applications of disentangled representation learning to improve performance on NLP, vision, and multimodal tasks.

#### Deep generative models for video, text, and audio generation
**Contact person:** [Paul Liang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pliang/){:target="\_blank"}

Generative models are important for probabilistic reasoning within graphical models. Recent advancements in parameterizing these models using deep neural networks and optimizating using gradient-based techniques have enabled large scale modeling of high-dimensional, real-world data. Deep generative models have been successfully been applied for image, text, and audio generation.
You can explore new applications of deep generative models, improve the theoretical understanding and empirical optimization of deep generative models, design metrics for improved evaluation of deep generative models, and other new directions.

#### Squeezing NO TEARS: scalable Bayesian network structure learning
**Contact person:** [Xun Zheng](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xunzheng/){:target="\_blank"}

Estimating Bayesian network structure from data is one of the fundamental problems in graphical models. 
A similar problem of estimating Markov network structure has efficient solutions such as the graphical lasso [1]. 
However, compared to Markov networks, estimating Bayesian networks involves extra challenges: 1) the adjacency matrix is not symmetric; 2) the acyclicity constraint is combinatorial. 
Recently [2] proposed a smooth characterization of directed acyclic graphs, enabling continuous optimization for Bayesian network structure learning, similar to graphical lasso for Markov networks. 

In this project, your goal would be to scale up the algorithm of [2] to thousands of nodes. 
Some computation can be saved by exploiting the problem structure, and some computation can be made more efficient using various approximation techniques.

#### Optimization-based decoding for improved neural machine translation
**Contact person:** [Maruan Al-Shedivat](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mshediva/){:target="\_blank"}

Encoder-decoder [1] with attention [2] is a typical architecture of modern neural machine translation (NMT) systems.
Arguably, the quality of the decoder (as well as the decoding process itself) significantly affects translation and often requires large amounts of parallel training data.

In this project, your goal would be to explore the potential of building more efficient decoders using pre-trained target language models (LMs).
The idea is inspired by a recent technique used in model-based reinforcement learning [3]:

> Given a sentence in the source language and a pre-trained target LM, generate a sequence of words in the target language by starting from a random sequence and iteratively refining it to increase its likelihood under the given LM.

The challenge is to ensure that by optimizing the language model (that represents an unconditional distribution), the generated sentence is a valid translation (i.e., preserves the meaning of the source sentence).

#### Learning contextual models for personalization, interpretability, and beyond
**Contact person:** [Maruan Al-Shedivat](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mshediva/){:target="\_blank"}

Oftentimes, we would like the models of our data to be not only accurate, but also human-interpretable.
A recently developed class of models, called Contextual Explanation Networks (CENs) [1], provides a flexible way to achieve this: on a high level, it allows to learn families of contextualized simple/interpretable models (e.g., sparse linear), called explanations, which are 'glued' together via deep neural networks.
In essence, CENs model conditional probability distributions of the form $$P(Y \mid X, C)$$, distinguishing between semantic (or interpretable) features $$X$$ and non-semantic features $$C$$.
There is a number of interesting directions one could take CEN further.

1. **Beyond linear explanations.** <br>
The original paper [1] developed CEN with only linear explanations (for scalar and structured output spaces).
Is it possible to use other types of simple models?
For instance, lists of rules [2] or their causal version [3] is a popular method when it comes to interpretability.
However, is it possible to integrate such models into the CEN framework and make them trainable end-to-end?
Applications of ML in the healthcare domain may significantly benefit from such models.

2. **Beyond conditional models.** <br>
CEN was designed to represent conditional distributions, i.e., directly answer queries such as, *What is the probability of $$Y$$ given $$X$$ and $$C$$?*
The problem is that the model always requires having access to *two modalities* of the input ($$X$$ and $$C$$), which is a limitation, since in a real-world scenario, certain data modalities might be missing or hard to obtain.
Hence, is it possible to build a CEN model that works with missing or latent $$X$$ or $$C$$ variables?
Is building a contextual model for the join distribution over $$X, C, Y$$ the right way to go?

3. **CEN for few-shot learning and/or meta-learning.** <br>
Note the CEN framework technically uses DNNs to generate parameters for simpler models (to contextualize them).
More generally, part of the model is used to 'modulate' another part of the model, which has been successful in a number of areas [4], including zero-shot learning, multilingual translation [5], etc.
Multitask few-shot learning and meta-learning [6] pose a new interesting setup, in which contextual/conditional models could work very well [7].
Another direction to explore in your projects is the design and implementation of CEN-like models for these new tasks.

#### Hierarchical RL & Maximum Entropy RL

**Contact person:** [Lisa Lee](http://leelisa.com){:target="\_blank"}

Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically formulated as a **Markov decision process (MDP)** of an agent interacting with the environment to maximize its cumulative reward. More specifically, an MDP is a tuple $$(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$$ where $$\mathcal{S}$$ is a set of states, $$\mathcal{A}$$ is a set of actions, $$\mathcal{T}(s' \mid s, a)$$ is the transition probability of ending up in state $$s' \in \mathcal{S}$$ when executing action $$a \in \mathcal{A}$$ in state $$s \in \mathcal{S}$$, $$\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is the reward function, and $$\gamma \in (0, 1]$$ is a discount factor. A policy $$\pi$$ maps each state-action pair $$(s, a) \in \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A}$$ to the probability $$\pi(s, a)$$ of taking action $$a$$ when in state $$s$$. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes its cumulative discounted reward $$\mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_t \gamma^t r_t \right]$$.

In the last several years, deep learning has helped achieve major breakthroughs in RL by enabling methods to automatically learn features from high-dimensional observations (e.g., raw image pixels). These advances have especially benefited vision-based RL problems and robotic manipulation methods. Despite the progress, several key challenges limit the applicability and scalability of deep RL algorithms. For example, efficient exploration and long-term credit assignment remain core problems, especially in settings with sparse or delayed rewards. Another challenge is that the data inefficiency of deep RL algorithms makes training computationally expensive and difficult to scale in the complexity and number of tasks.

One framework to tackle these challenges is **hierarchical RL (HRL)**, which enables temporal abstraction by learning hierarchical policies operating at different timescales and decomposing tasks into smaller subtasks. Another interesting line of work is **maximum entropy RL** which encourages agents to learn diverse behaviors agnostic of the task.

I'd be happy to share more specific project ideas and advise students. Please feel free to stop by office hours if interested.

#### Machine Learning on/with Graphs

**Contact person:** [Hao Zhang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhang2/){:target="\_blank"}

Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Below are a few interesting topics that have been developed very actively in recently years and worth some explorations in the class:

- **Deep Generative Models for Graphs** [1, 2, 4]
- **Combing Graphical Models with Neural Networks** [1-5]
- **Semi-supervised Learning on Graph-structured Data** [3, 5]

#### Automated Machine Learning

**Contact person:** [Hao Zhang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhang2/){:target="\_blank"}

The goal of AutoML is to make machine learning more accessible by automatically generating a data analysis pipeline that can include data pre-processing, feature selection, and feature engineering methods along with machine learning methods and parameter settings that are optimized for your data. Recently we have witnessed very active development toward a few directions such as hyperparameter searching, neural architecture search, etc. However, most of the existing methods only address a very small component from an end-to-end ML pipeline (from data to values), and they usually exhibit unsatisfactory efficiency and scalability.

- **Efficient Search for Better Model Architectures, Optimization Methods, or Both** [1-5, 7, 8, 9]
- **Searching for Better End-to-end ML Pipelines** [7]
- **AutoML (for) Systems** [6, 9]
